# GPT-CHATTER (MINI- PROJECT)
This chatbot provides instant time and weather updates upon user request. Users interact through text commands, receiving current time or weather for specified cities. It also features text-to-speech functionality for accessibility.
Welcome to my basic chatbot project! This simple yet effective chatbot provides users with real-time updates on both time and weather conditions through a straightforward text interface. Users interact with the bot by typing commands or queries, with key triggers such as "time" or "weather" prompting the bot to retrieve the requested information using relevant APIs. For time-related inquiries, the bot promptly displays the current time, while for weather queries, users are prompted to specify a city, enabling the bot to fetch and present the current temperature for the desired location. Moreover, the bot is equipped with text-to-speech capabilities, enhancing accessibility by audibly communicating responses to users. Whether you're in need of a quick time check or want to know the weather in your area, our basic chatbot is here to assist you with timely and relevant updates in a user-friendly manner.

Before running the code, you need to install "Pip install pyttsx3 pyown".

"pyttsx3": This is the name of the first package being installed. It is a Python library that provides text-to-speech functionality, allowing the chatbot to convert text responses into spoken words.

"pyowm": This is the name of the second package being installed. It is a Python wrapper for the OpenWeatherMap API, which allows the chatbot to retrieve weather information based on user input.
